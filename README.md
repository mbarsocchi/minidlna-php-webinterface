# minidlna-php-webinterface
Web Interface for minidlna server. Set you setting in file config.php

- Player mp3 for file
- browser of photo responsive
- Video not embedded in browser (only link to file.... TODO maybe..)


I use this with raspberry-pi and minidlna, with the DYNDNS service I can access all of my file from outside
